### Unpublished games in pascal language
**Pascal** is a high-level programming language designed in the late 1960s by Niklaus Wirth to encourage good programming practices and structured programming. Named after the mathematician Blaise Pascal, the language emphasizes clear syntax and a strong type system, which help in writing reliable and maintainable code. Pascal supports procedural programming with a focus on structured control flow and modular programming, making it suitable for teaching programming concepts and developing early software. It gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s for applications in education and systems programming. Pascal's influence is seen in many modern programming languages, and its variants, such as Object Pascal, have contributed to the development of languages like Delphi. Despite being less commonly used today, Pascalâ€™s design principles continue to impact software development practices.
